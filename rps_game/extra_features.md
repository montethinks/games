**Keeping score**

Right now, the game doesn't have very much dramatic flair. It'll be more interesting if we were playing up to, say, 10 points. Whoever reaches 10 points first wins. Can you build this functionality? We have a new noun -- a score. Is that a new class, or a state of an existing class? You can explore both options and see which one works better.

**Add Lizard and Spock**

This is a variation on the normal Rock Paper Scissors game by adding two ore options- Lizard and Spock. The full explanation and rules are at http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html.

**Add a class for each move**

What would happen if we went even further and introduced 5 more classes, one for each move: ```Rock```, ```Paper```, ```Scissors```, ```Lizard```, and ```Spock```. How would the code change? After you're done, can you talk about whether this was a good design decision? What are the pros/cons?

**Keep track of a history of moves**

As long as the user doesn't quit, keep track of a history of moves by both the human and computer. What data structure will you reach for? Will you use a new class, or an existing class? What will the display output look like?

**Adjust computer choice based on history**

Come up with some rules based on the history of moves in order for the computer to make a future more. For example, if the human tends to win over 60% of his hands when the computer chooses "rock", then decrease the likelihood of choosing "rock". You'll have to first come up with a rule (like the one in the previous sentence), then implement some analysis on history to see if the history matches that rule, then adjust the weight of each choice when making the move. Right now, the computer has a 33% chance to make any of the 3 moves.

**Computer Personalities**

We have a list of robot names for our ```Computer``` class, but other than the name, there's really nothing different about each of them. It's be interesting to explore how to build different personalities for each robot. For example, R2D2 can always choose "rock". Or, "Hal" can have a very high tendency to choose "scissors", and rarely "rock", but never "paper".

You can come up with the rules or personalities for each robot. How would you approach a feature like this?
